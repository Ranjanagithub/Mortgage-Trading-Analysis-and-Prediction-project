Project Aim: To predict the mortgage backed securities prepayment risk using machine learning models
This project will provide a predictive model that can help mortgage lenders and servicers to identify prepayment-risk of loans.

A. Problem statement understanding :
A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an investment secured by a collection of mortgages bought by the banks that issued them. Mortgage-backed securities are bought and sold on the secondary market in other words MBS is a type of asset-backed security collateralised by a pool of mortgages. This essentially represents transfer of credit risk from a primary lender, typically the originating bank, to an investment bank.

Prepayment risk is the risk involved with the premature return of principal on a fixed-income security. When prepayment occurs, investors must reinvest at current market interest rates, which are usually substantially lower. Prepayment risk mostly affects corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Prepayment is a risk for mortgage lenders and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) investors that people will pay their loans off earlier than the full term. This prevents them from getting interest payments for the long amount of time as they'd counted on.
B. Data undrstanding:
we have the Freddie Mac dataset. It is one of the largest mortgage financing companies in the United States. It consist of 291451 number of rows and 28 columns.
